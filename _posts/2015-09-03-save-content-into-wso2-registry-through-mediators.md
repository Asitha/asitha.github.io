>  With `ESB 4.9.0` release we can achieve this directly using the property mediators registry scope.


In WSO2 `ESB 4.8.1` there is no direct way to save content to registry through stock synapse mediators. This post describes two possible options we have with `ESB 4.8.1` to save content to the registry. Those are by using either the [Script Mediator](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ESB481/Script+Mediator) or the [Class Mediator](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ESB481/Class+Mediator).

Following examples shows how to store the value of property `myProperty` of type String in message context into the registry path
`conf:/store/myStore`

## Script Mediator

Achieving this with script mediator is relatively easy. **Note that using the script mediator will have some performance impact on your mediation logic.**

Here is a sample code snippet of a script mediator to save the value stored under `myProperty` in message context to the registry.

## Class Mediator

First of all, you need to create a class mediator. You can follow [this](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ESB481 /Writing+a+WSO2+ESB+Mediator) guide to write your own class mediator. After that what you need is to write some Java code similar to following to store the content into the registry.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Asitha/481688f06ab156737985.js"></script>

## Retrieve content

To retrieve the stored content you can simply use the `get-property` XPath function with `registry` scope as follows.

```xml
<property name="regContent"
          expression="get-property('registry', 'conf:/store/myStore')"/>

```

*Cheers!*
